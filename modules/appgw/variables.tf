variable "zones" {
  description = <<-EOF
  A list of zones the Application Gateway should be available in.

  NOTICE: this is also enforced on the Public IP. The Public IP object brings in some limitations as it can only be non-zonal, pinned to a single zone or zone-redundant (so available in all zones in a region). 
  Therefore make sure that if you specify more than one zone you specify all available in a region. You can use a subset, but the Public IP will be created in all zones anyway. This fact will cause terraform to recreate the IP resource during next `terraform apply` as there will be difference between the state and the actual configuration.

  For details on zones currently available in a region of your choice refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-region).

  Example:
  ```
  zones = ["1","2","3"]

  Name of an SSL policy. Supported only for `ssl_policy_type` set to `Predefined`. Normally you can set it also for `Custom` policies but the name is discarded on Azure side causing an update to Application Gateway each time terraform code is run. Therefore this property is omited in the code for `Custom` policies. 
  
  For the `Predefined` polcies, check the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-ssl-policy-overview) for possible values as they tend to change over time. The default value is currently (Q1 2022) a Microsoft's default.

  ```

      ssl_policy_min_protocol_version = string

  For possible values check the: `ssl_policy_type`, `ssl_policy_min_protocol_version` and `ssl_policy_cipher_suites` variables as SSL profile is a named SSL policy - same properties apply. The only difference is that you cannot name an SSL policy inside an SSL profile.
