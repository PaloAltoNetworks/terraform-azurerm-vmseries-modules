# NAT Gateway module

## Purpose
  
Terraform module used to deploy Azure NAT Gateway. For limitations and
zone-resiliency considerations please refer to [Microsoft
documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-overview).
 
This module can be used to either create a new NAT Gateway or to connect
an existing one with subnets deployed using (for example) the [VNET
module](../vnet/README.md).

## Usage

To deploy this resource in it's minimum configuration following code
snippet can be used (assuming that the VNET module is used to deploy VNET
and Subnets):

```hcl
module "natgw" {
  source = "PaloAltoNetworks/vmseries-modules/azurerm//modules/natgw"

  name                = "NATGW_name"
  resource_group_name = "resource_group_name"
  location            = "region_name"
  subnet_ids          = { "a_subnet_name" =
module.vnet.subnet_ids["a_subnet_name"] }
}
```

This will create a NAT Gateway in with a single Public IP in a zone chosen
by Azure.
