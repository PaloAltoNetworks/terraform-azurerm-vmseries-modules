# Palo Alto Networks VM-Series Module for Azure

A Terraform module for deploying a VM-Series firewall in Azure cloud.
The module is not intended for use with Scale Sets.

## Usage

For usage please refer to any reference architecture example.

## Accept Azure Marketplace Terms

Accept the Azure Marketplace terms for the VM-Series images. In a typical situation use these commands:

```sh
az vm image terms accept --publisher paloaltonetworks --offer vmseries-flex --plan byol --subscription MySubscription
az vm image terms accept --publisher paloaltonetworks --offer vmseries-flex --plan bundle1 --subscription MySubscription
az vm image terms accept --publisher paloaltonetworks --offer vmseries-flex --plan bundle2 --subscription MySubscription
```

You can revoke the acceptance later with the `az vm image terms cancel` command.
The acceptance applies to the entirety of your Azure Subscription.

## Caveat Regarding Region

By default, the VM-Series is placed into an Availability Zone "1". Hence, it can only deploy
successfully in the [Regions that support Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-region).
If your Region doesn't, use an alternative mechanism of Availability Set, which is inferior but universally supported:

```hcl
   avset_id = azurerm_availability_set.this.id
   avzone   = null
```
