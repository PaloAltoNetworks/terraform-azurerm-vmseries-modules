# Load Balancer Module for Azure

A Terraform module for deploying a Load Balancer for VM-Series firewalls. Supports both standalone and scale set deployments. Note, that due to that some properties are mutually exclusive. Please check the properties' description.

The module creates a single load balancer and a single backend for it, but it allows multiple frontends.

In case of a public load balancer, you can define outbound rules and use the frontend's public IP address to access the internet. If this approach is chosen please note that all inbound rules will have the outbound SNAT disabled as you cannot mix SNAT with outbound rules for a single backend.

## Usage

For usage see any of the reference architecture examples.
