# Palo Alto Networks VMSS Module for Azure

A terraform module for deploying a Scale Set based on Next Generation Firewalls in Azure.

**NOTE!** \
Due to [lack of proper method of running health probes](#about-rolling-upgrades-and-auto-healing) against Pan-OS based VMs running
in a Scale Set, the `upgrade_mode` property is hardcoded to `Manual`.

For this mode to actually work the `roll_instances_when_required` provider feature has to be also configured and set to `false`.
Unfortunately this cannot be set in the `vmss` module, it has to be specified in the **root** module.

Therefore, when using this module please add the following `provider` block to your code:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {
    virtual_machine_scale_set {
      roll_instances_when_required = false
    }
  }
}
```

## About rolling upgrades and auto healing

Both, the rolling upgrade mode and auto healing target the 1<sup>st</sup> NIC on a Scale Set VM with a health probe to verify if
the VM is capable of handling traffic. Furthermore, for the health probe to work the 1<sup>st</sup> interface has to be added to
a Load Balancer.

This provides some obstacles when deploying such setup with Next Generation Firewall based Scale Set: most importantly the health
probe would target the management interface which could lead to false-positives. A management service can respond to TCP/Http
probes, while the data plane remains unconfigured. An easy solution would to bo configure an interface swap, unfortunately this
is not available in the Azure VM-Series image yet.

## Custom Metrics and Autoscaling

Firewalls can publish custom metrics (for example `panSessionUtilization`) to Azure Application Insights to improve the
autoscaling. This is a suggested way of setting up scaling rules as these metrics are gathered only from the data plane.

This however requires some additional steps:

- deploy the [`ngfw_metrics`](../ngfw_metrics/README.md) module, this module outputs two properties:
  - `application_insights_ids` - a map of IDs of the deployed Application Insights instances
  - `metrics_instrumentation_keys` - a map of instrumentation keys for the deployed Application Insights instances
- configure this module with the ID of the desired Application Insights instance, use the
  [`var.autoscaling_configuration.application_insights_id`](#autoscaling_configuration) property
- depending on the bootstrap method you use, configure the PAN-OS VM-Series plugins with the metrics instrumentation key
  belonging to the Application Insights instance of your choice.

The metrics gathered within a single Azure Application Insights instance provided by the module, cannot be split to obtain
back a result for solely a single firewall. Thus for example if three firewalls use the same Instrumentation Key and report
their respective session utilizations as 90%, 20%, 10%, it is possible to see in Azure the average of 40%, the sum of 120%,
the max of 90%, but it is *not possible* to know which of the firewalls reported the 90% utilization.

Therefore each Scale Set instance should be configured with a dedicated Application Insights instance.

## Usage

Below you can find a simple example deploying a Scale Set w/o autoscaling, using defaults where possible:

```hcl
module "vmss" {
  source = "PaloAltoNetworks/vmseries-modules/azurerm//modules/vmss"

  name                = "ngfw-vmss"
  resource_group_name = "hub-rg"
  location            = "West Europe"

  authentication = {
    username                        = "panadmin"
    password                        = "c0mpl1c@t3d"
    disable_password_authentication = true
  }
  vm_image_configuration = {
    img_version = "10.2.4"
  }
  scale_set_configuration = {}
  interfaces = [
    {
      name      = "managmeent"
      subnet_id = "management_subnet_ID_string"
    },
    {
      name                = "private"
      subnet_id           = "private_subnet_ID_string"
      lb_backend_pool_ids = ["LBI_backend_pool_ID"]
    },
    {
      name                   = "managmeent"
      subnet_id              = "management_subnet_ID_string"
      lb_backend_pool_ids    = ["LBE_backend_pool_ID"]
      appgw_backend_pool_ids = ["AppGW_backend_pool_ID"]
    }
  ]

  autoscaling_configuration = {}
  autoscaling_profiles      = []
}
```
