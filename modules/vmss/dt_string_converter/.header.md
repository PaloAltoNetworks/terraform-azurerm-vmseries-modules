# Palo Alto Date/Time string representation converted

This is a very simply module used solely to convert time in minutes to a string representation required by the
Azure Scale Set's autoscaling metrics rules. 

It's a sub module of the `vmss` module created to deduplicate code required to perform the conversion between
two formats. However it can be, it was not designed to be used outside of the `vmss` module.
