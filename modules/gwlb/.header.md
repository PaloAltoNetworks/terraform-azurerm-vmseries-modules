# Gateway Load Balancer Module for Azure

A Terraform module for deploying a Gateway Load Balancer for VM-Series firewalls.

## Usage

In order to use GWLB, below minimal definition of Gateway Load Balancer can be used, for which:
- only name, VNet and subnet are defined
- default frontend IP configuration is used (Dynamic IPv4)
- zones 1, 2, 3 are configured (GWLB is zone redundant)
- default load balancing rule is used (with default load distribution)
- default health probe is used (protocol TCP on port 80)
- default 1 backend is configured (with 2 tunnel interfaces on ports 2000, 2001)

```hcl
  gwlb = {
    name = "vmseries-gwlb"

    frontend_ip = {
      vnet_key   = "security"
      subnet_key = "data"
    }
  }
```

For more customized requirements, below extended definition of GWLB can be applied, for which:
- frontend IP has custom name and static private IP address
- there are no zones defined
- custom name for load balancing rule is defined
- custom name and port for health probe is configured
- 2 backends are defined (external and internal)

```hcl
  gwlb2 = {
    name  = "vmseries-gwlb2"
    zones = []

    frontend_ip = {
      name               = "custom-name-frontend-ip"
      vnet_key           = "security"
      subnet_key         = "data"
      private_ip_address = "10.0.1.24"
    }

    lb_rule = {
      name = "custom-name-lb-rule"
    }

    health_probe = {
      name = "custom-name-health-probe"
      port = 80
    }

    backends = {
      ext = {
        name = "external"
        tunnel_interfaces = {
          external = {
            identifier = 801
            port       = 2001
            protocol   = "VXLAN"
            type       = "External"
          }
        }
      }
      int = {
        name = "internal"
        tunnel_interfaces = {
          internal = {
            identifier = 800
            port       = 2000
            protocol   = "VXLAN"
            type       = "Internal"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```
