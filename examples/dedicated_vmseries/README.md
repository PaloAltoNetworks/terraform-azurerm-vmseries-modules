# Reference Architecture with Terraform: VM-Series in Azure, Centralized Architecture, Dedicated Inbound NGFW Option

Palo Alto Networks produces several
[validated reference architecture design and deployment documentation guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures),
which describe well-architected and tested deployments. When deploying VM-Series in a public cloud, the reference architectures
guide users toward the best security outcomes, whilst reducing rollout time and avoiding common integration efforts.

The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls in Azure based on a centralized design with
dedicated-inbound VM-Series; for a discussion of other options, please see the design guide from
[the reference architecture guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures).

## Reference Architecture Design

![simple](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-azurerm-vmseries-modules/assets/6574404/a7c2452d-f926-49da-bf21-9d840282a0a2)

This code implements:

- a *centralized design*, a hub-and-spoke topology with a Transit VNet containing VM-Series to inspect all inbound, outbound,
  east-west, and enterprise traffic
- the *dedicated inbound option*, which separates inbound traffic flows onto a separate set of VM-Series.

## Detailed Architecture and Design

### Centralized Design

This design uses a Transit VNet. Application functions and resources are deployed across multiple VNets that are connected in
a hub-and-spoke topology. The hub of the topology, or transit VNet, is the central point of connectivity for all inbound,
outbound, east-west, and enterprise traffic. You deploy all VM-Series firewalls within the transit VNet.

### Dedicated Inbound Option

The dedicated inbound option separates traffic flows across two separate sets of VM-Series firewalls. One set of VM-Series
firewalls is dedicated to inbound traffic flows, allowing for greater flexibility and scaling of inbound traffic loads.
The second set of VM-Series firewalls services all outbound, east-west, and enterprise network traffic flows. This deployment
choice offers increased scale and operational resiliency and reduces the chances of high bandwidth use from the inbound traffic
flows affecting other traffic flows within the deployment.

![Detailed Topology Diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2110772/234920818-44e4082d-b445-4ffc-b0cb-174ef1e3c2ae.png)

This reference architecture consists of:

- a VNET containing:
  - 3 subnets dedicated to the firewalls: management, private and public
  - Route Tables and Network Security Groups
- 2 Load Balancers:
  - public - with a public IP address assigned, in front of the firewalls public interfaces, for incoming traffic
  - private - in front of the firewalls private interfaces, for outgoing and east-west traffic
- a Storage Account used to keep bootstrap packages containing `DAY0` configuration for the firewalls
- 4 firewalls:
  - deployed in different zones
  - 2 pairs, one for inbound, the other for outbound and east-west traffic
  - with 3 network interfaces each: management, public, private
  - with public IP addresses assigned to:
    - management interface
    - public interface

## Prerequisites

A list of requirements might vary depending on the platform used to deploy the infrastructure but a minimum one includes:

- (in case of non cloud shell deployment) credentials and (optionally) tools required to authenticate against Azure Cloud, see
  [AzureRM provider documentation for details](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure)
- [supported](#requirements) version of [`Terraform`](<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads>)
- if you have not run Palo Alto NGFW images in a subscription it might be necessary to accept the license first
  ([see this note](../../modules/vmseries/README.md#accept-azure-marketplace-terms))

**Note!**
- after the deployment the firewalls remain not licensed, they do however contain minimum `DAY0` configuration (required NIC, VR,
  routes configuration).
- this example contains some **files** that **can contain sensitive data**. Keep in mind that **this code** is
  **only an example**. It's main purpose is to introduce the Terraform modules.

## Usage

### Deployment Steps

- checkout the code locally (if you haven't done so yet)
- copy the [`example.tfvars`](./example.tfvars) file, rename it to `terraform.tfvars` and adjust it to your needs (take a closer
  look at the `TODO` markers)
- copy the [`init-cfg.sample.txt`](./files/init-cfg.sample.txt) to `init-cfg.txt` and fill it out with required bootstrap
  parameters (see this [documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/9-1/vm-series-deployment/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall/create-the-init-cfgtxt-file/init-cfgtxt-file-components#id07933d91-15be-414d-bc8d-f2a5f3d8df6b) for details)
- (optional) authenticate to AzureRM, switch to the Subscription of your choice if necessary
- initialize the Terraform module:

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

- (optional) plan you infrastructure to see what will be actually deployed:

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```

- deploy the infrastructure (you will have to confirm it with typing in `yes`):

  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

  The deployment takes couple of minutes. Observe the output. At the end you should see a summary similar to this:

  ```console
  bootstrap_storage_urls = <sensitive>
  lb_frontend_ips = {
    "private" = {
      "ha-ports" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
    "public" = {
      "palo-lb-app1-pip" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
  }
  password = <sensitive>
  username = "panadmin"
  vmseries_mgmt_ips = {
    "fw-in-1" = "1.2.3.4"
    "fw-in-2" = "1.2.3.4"
    "fw-obew-1" = "1.2.3.4"
    "fw-obew-2" = "1.2.3.4"
  }
  ```

- at this stage you have to wait couple of minutes for the firewalls to bootstrap.

### Post deploy

Firewalls in this example are configured with password authentication. To retrieve the initial credentials run:

- for username:

  ```bash
  terraform output username
  ```

- for password:

  ```bash
  terraform output password
  ```

The management public IP addresses are available in the `vmseries_mgmt_ips`:

```bash
terraform output vmseries_mgmt_ips
```

You can now login to the devices using either:

- cli - ssh client is required
- Web UI (https) - any modern web browser, note that initially the traffic is encrypted with a self-signed certificate.

As mentioned, the devices already contain `DAY0` configuration, so all network interfaces should be configured and Azure Load
Balancer should already report that the devices are healthy.

You can now proceed with licensing the devices and configuring your first rules.

Please also refer to [this repository](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/iron-skillet) for `DAY1` configuration
(security hardening).

### Cleanup

To remove the deployed infrastructure run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Following properties are supported:
- `name` - name of the Application Insights.
- `update_domain_count` - specifies the number of update domains that are used, defaults to 5 (Azure defaults).
- `fault_domain_count` - specifies the number of fault domains that are used, defaults to 3 (Azure defaults).

Please keep in mind that Azure defaults are not working for each region (especially the small ones, w/o any Availability Zones).
Please verify how many update and fault domain are supported in a region before deploying this resource.


Type: 

```hcl
map(object({
    name                = string
    update_domain_count = optional(number, 5)

#### ngfw_metrics

A map controlling metrics-relates resources.

When set to explicit `null` (default) it will disable any metrics resources in this deployment.

When defined it will either create or source a Log Analytics Workspace and create Application Insights instances (one per each
Scale Set). All instances will be automatically connected to the workspace.
The name of the Application Insights instance will be derived from the Scale Set name and suffixed with `-ai`.

All the settings available below are common to the Log Analytics Workspace and Application Insight instances.

Following properties are available:

- `name`                      - (`string`, required) name of the (common) Log Analytics Workspace
- `create_workspace`          - (`bool`, optional, defaults to `true`) controls whether we create or source an existing Log
                                Analytics Workspace
- `resource_group_name`       - (`string`, optional, defaults to `var.resource_group_name`) name of the Resource Group hosting
                                the Log Analytics Workspace
- `sku`                       - (`string`, optional, defaults to module defaults) the SKU of the Log Analytics Workspace.
- `metrics_retention_in_days` - (`number`, optional, defaults to module defaults) workspace and insights data retention in
                                days, possible values are between 30 and 730. For sourced Workspaces this applies only to 
                                the Application Insights instances.


Type: 

```hcl
object({
    name                      = string
    create_workspace          = optional(bool, true)
    resource_group_name       = optional(string)
    sku                       = optional(string)

#### bootstrap_storages

A map defining Azure Storage Accounts used to host file shares for bootstrapping NGFWs.

You can create or re-use an existing Storage Account and/or File Share. For details on all available properties please refer to
[module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap/README.md). Following is just an extract of the most important ones:

- `name`                      - (`string`, required) name of the Storage Account that will be created or sourced.

    **Note** \
    For new Storage Accounts this name will not be prefixed with `var.name_prefix`. \
    Please note the limitations on naming. This has to be a globally unique name, between 3 and 63 chars, only lower-case
    letters and numbers.

- `resource_group_name`       - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) name of the Resource Group that hosts (sourced) or will
                                host (created) a Storage Account. When skipped the code will fall back to
                                `var.resource_group_name`.
- `storage_account`           - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map controlling basic Storage Account configuration, for
                                detailed documentation see 
                                [module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap/README.md#storage_account). The property you
                                should pay attention to is:
  - `create`                    - (`bool`, optional, defaults to module defaults) controls if the Storage Account specified in
                                the `name` property will be created or sourced.
- `storage_network_security`  - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map defining network security settings for a **new**
                                storage account, for details see
                                [module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap/README.md#storage_network_security). Properties
                                worth mentioning are:
  - `allowed_subnet_keys`       - (`list`, optional, defaults to `[]`) a list of keys pointing to Subnet definitions in the
                                  `var.vnets` map. These Subnets will have dedicated access to the Storage Account. For this to
                                  work they also need to have the Storage Account Service Endpoint enabled.
  - `vnet_key`                  - a key pointing to a VNET definition in the `var.vnets` map that stores the Subnets described 
                                  in `allowed_subnet_keys`.
- `file_shares_configuration` - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map defining common File Share setting. For detailed
                                documentation see
                                [module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap/README.md#file_shares_configuration). The
                                properties you should pay your attention to are:
  - `create_file_shares`            - (`bool`, optional, defaults to module defaults) controls if the File Shares defined in the
                                      `file_shares` property will be created or sourced.
  - `disable_package_dirs_creation` - (`bool`, optional, defaults to module defaults) for sourced File Shares, controls if the
                                      bootstrap package folder structure will be created.
- `file_shares`               - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map that holds File Shares and bootstrap package
                                configuration. For detailed description see
                                [module's documentation](../../modules/bootstrap/README.md#file_shares).

#### vmseries

A map defining Azure Virtual Machines based on Palo Alto Networks Next Generation Firewall image..

For details and defaults for available options please refer to the [`vmseries`](../../modules/vmseries/README.md) module.

The most basic properties are as follows:

- `name`            - (`string`, required) name of the VM, will be prefixed with the value of `var.name_prefix`.
- `authentication`  - (`map`, optional, defaults to example defaults) authentication settings for the deployed VM.

    The `authentication` property is optional and holds the firewall admin access details. By default, standard username
    `panadmin` will be set and a random password will be auto-generated for you (available in Terraform outputs).

    **Note!** \
    The `disable_password_authentication` property is by default `false` in this example. When using this value, you don't have
    to specify anything but you can still additionally pass SSH keys for authentication. You can however set this property to 
    `true`, then you have to specify `ssh_keys` property.

    For all properties and their default values see [module's documentation](../../modules/vmseries/README.md#authentication).

- `image`           - (`map`, required) properties defining a base image used by the deployed VM.

    The `image` property is required but there are only 2 properties (mutually exclusive) that have to be set, either:

    - `version`   - (`string`) describes the PAN-OS image version from Azure Marketplace.
    - `custom_id` - (`string`) absolute ID of your own custom PAN-OS image.

    For details on the other properties refer to [module's documentation](../../modules/vmseries/README.md#image).

- `virtual_machine` - (`map`, optional, defaults to module defaults) a map that groups most common VM configuration options.

    The most often used option are as follows:

    - `vnet_key`  - (`string`, required) a key of a VNET defined in `var.vnets`. This is the VNET that hosts subnets used to
                    deploy network interfaces for deployed VM.
    - `size`      - (`string`, optional, defaults to module defaults) Azure VM size (type). Consult the *VM-Series Deployment
                    Guide* as only a few selected sizes are supported.
    - `zone`      - (`string`, optional, defaults to module defaults) the Availability Zone in which the VM and (if deployed)
                    public IP addresses will be created.
    - `disk_type` - (`string`, optional, defaults to module defaults) type of a Managed Disk which should be created, possible
                    values are `Standard_LRS`, `StandardSSD_LRS` or `Premium_LRS` (works only for selected `size` values).
    - `bootstrap_options` - (`string`, optional, mutually exclusive with `bootstrap_package`) bootstrap options passed to PAN-OS
                            when launched for the 1st time, for details see module documentation.
    - `bootstrap_package` - (`map`, optional, mutually exclusive with `bootstrap_options`) a map defining content of the
                            bootstrap package.

        **Note!** \
        At least one of `static_files`, `bootstrap_xml_template` or `bootstrap_package_path` is required. You can use a
        combination of all 3. The `bootstrap_package_path` is the less important. For details on this mechanism and for details
        on the other properties see the [`bootstrap` module documentation](../../modules/bootstrap/README.md).

        Following properties are available:

        - `bootstrap_storage_key`  - (`string`, required) a key of a bootstrap storage defined in `var.bootstrap_storages` that
                                     will host bootstrap packages. Each package will be hosted on a separate File Share.
                                     The File Shares will be created automatically, one for each firewall.
        - `static_files`           - (`map`, optional, defaults to `{}`) a map containing files that will be copied to a File
                                     Share, see [`file_shares.bootstrap_files`](../../modules/bootstrap/README.md#file_shares)
                                     property documentation for details.
        - `bootstrap_package_path` - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a path to a folder containing a full bootstrap
                                     package.
        - `bootstrap_xml_template` - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a path to a `bootstrap.xml` template. If this
                                     example is using full bootstrap method, the sample templates are in
                                     [`templates`](./templates) folder.

            The templates are used to provide `day0` like configuration which consists of:

            - network interfaces configuration.
            - one or more (depending on the architecture) Virtual Routers configurations. This config contains static routes
              required for the Load Balancer (and Application Gateway, if defined) health checks to work and routes that allow
              Inbound and OBEW traffic.
            - *any-any* security rule.
            - an outbound NAT rule that will allow the Outbound traffic to flow to the internet.

            **Note!** \
            Day0 configuration is **not meant** to be **secure**. It's here marly to help with the basic firewall setup.

            When `bootstrap_xml_template` is set, one of the following properties might be required.

        - `private_snet_key`       - (`string`, required only when `bootstrap_xml_template` is set, defaults to `null`) a key
                                     pointing to a private Subnet definition in `var.vnets` (the `vnet_key` property is used to
                                     identify a VNET). The Subnet definition is used to calculate static routes for a private
                                     Load Balancer health checks and for Inbound traffic.
        - `public_snet_key`        - (`string`, required only when `bootstrap_xml_template` is set, defaults to `null`) a key
                                     pointing to a public Subnet definition in `var.vnets` (the `vnet_key` property is used to
                                     identify a VNET). The Subnet definition is used to calculate static routes for a public
                                     Load Balancer health checks and for Outbound traffic.
        - `ai_update_interval`     - (`number`, optional, defaults to `5`) Application Insights update interval, used only when
                                     `ngfw_metrics` module is defined and used in this example. The Application Insights
                                     Instrumentation Key will be populated automatically.
        - `intranet_cidr`          - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) a CIDR of the Intranet - combined CIDR of all
                                     private networks. When set it will override the private Subnet CIDR for inbound traffic
                                     static routes.
      
    For details on the other properties refer to [module's documentation](../../modules/panorama/README.md#virtual_machine).

- `interfaces`      - (`list`, required) configuration of all network interfaces
  
    **Note!** \
    Order of the interfaces does matter - the 1<sup>st</sup> interface is the management one. 

    For details on available properties please see [module's documentation](../../modules/panorama/README.md#interfaces).

    The most important ones are listed below:

    - `name`                    - (`string`, required) name of the network interface (will be prefixed with `var.name_prefix`).
    - `subnet_key`              - (`string`, required) a key of a subnet to which the interface will be assigned as defined in
                                  `var.vnets`. Key identifying the VNET is defined in `virtual_machine.vnet_key` property.
    - `create_public_ip`        - (`bool`, optional, defaults to `false`) create a Public IP for an interface.
    - `load_balancer_key`       - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) key of a Load Balancer defined in `var.loadbalancers`
                                  variable, network interface that has this property defined will be added to the Load
                                  Balancer's backend pool.
    - `application_gateway_key` - (`string`, optional, defaults to `null`) key of an Application Gateway defined in `var.appgws`
                                  variable, network interface that has this property defined will be added to the Application
                                  Gateway's backend pool.
