# Reference Architecture with Terraform: VM-Series in Azure, Centralized Architecture, Dedicated Inbound NGFW Option

Palo Alto Networks produces several
[validated reference architecture design and deployment documentation guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures),
which describe well-architected and tested deployments. When deploying VM-Series in a public cloud, the reference architectures
guide users toward the best security outcomes, whilst reducing rollout time and avoiding common integration efforts.

The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls in Azure based on a centralized design with
dedicated-inbound VM-Series; for a discussion of other options, please see the design guide from
[the reference architecture guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures).

## Reference Architecture Design

![simple](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-azurerm-vmseries-modules/assets/6574404/a7c2452d-f926-49da-bf21-9d840282a0a2)

This code implements:

- a *centralized design*, a hub-and-spoke topology with a Transit VNet containing VM-Series to inspect all inbound, outbound,
  east-west, and enterprise traffic
- the *dedicated inbound option*, which separates inbound traffic flows onto a separate set of VM-Series.

## Detailed Architecture and Design

### Centralized Design

This design uses a Transit VNet. Application functions and resources are deployed across multiple VNets that are connected in
a hub-and-spoke topology. The hub of the topology, or transit VNet, is the central point of connectivity for all inbound,
outbound, east-west, and enterprise traffic. You deploy all VM-Series firewalls within the transit VNet.

### Dedicated Inbound Option

The dedicated inbound option separates traffic flows across two separate sets of VM-Series firewalls. One set of VM-Series
firewalls is dedicated to inbound traffic flows, allowing for greater flexibility and scaling of inbound traffic loads.
The second set of VM-Series firewalls services all outbound, east-west, and enterprise network traffic flows. This deployment
choice offers increased scale and operational resiliency and reduces the chances of high bandwidth use from the inbound traffic
flows affecting other traffic flows within the deployment.

This reference architecture consists of:

- a VNET containing:
  - 3 subnets dedicated to the firewalls: management, private and public
  - Route Tables and Network Security Groups
- 2 Load Balancers:
  - public - with a public IP address assigned, in front of the firewalls public interfaces, for incoming traffic
  - private - in front of the firewalls private interfaces, for outgoing and east-west traffic
- a Storage Account used to keep bootstrap packages containing `DAY0` configuration for the firewalls
- 4 firewalls:
  - deployed in different zones
  - 2 pairs, one for inbound, the other for outbound and east-west traffic
  - with 3 network interfaces each: management, public, private
  - with public IP addresses assigned to:
    - management interface
    - public interface

## Prerequisites

A list of requirements might vary depending on the platform used to deploy the infrastructure but a minimum one includes:

- (in case of non cloud shell deployment) credentials and (optionally) tools required to authenticate against Azure Cloud, see
  [AzureRM provider documentation for details](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure)
- [supported](#requirements) version of [`Terraform`](<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads>)
- if you have not run Palo Alto NGFW images in a subscription it might be necessary to accept the license first
  ([see this note](../../modules/vmseries/README.md#accept-azure-marketplace-terms))

**Note!**
- after the deployment the firewalls remain not licensed, they do however contain minimum `DAY0` configuration (required NIC, VR,
  routes configuration).
- this example contains some **files** that **can contain sensitive data**. Keep in mind that **this code** is
  **only an example**. It's main purpose is to introduce the Terraform modules.

## Usage

### Deployment Steps

- checkout the code locally (if you haven't done so yet)
- copy the [`example.tfvars`](./example.tfvars) file, rename it to `terraform.tfvars` and adjust it to your needs (take a closer
  look at the `TODO` markers)
- copy the [`init-cfg.sample.txt`](./files/init-cfg.sample.txt) to `init-cfg.txt` and fill it out with required bootstrap 
  parameters (see this [documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/9-1/vm-series-deployment/bootstrap-the-vm-series-firewall/create-the-init-cfgtxt-file/init-cfgtxt-file-components#id07933d91-15be-414d-bc8d-f2a5f3d8df6b) for details)
- (optional) authenticate to AzureRM, switch to the Subscription of your choice if necessary
- initialize the Terraform module:

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

- (optional) plan you infrastructure to see what will be actually deployed:

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```

- deploy the infrastructure (you will have to confirm it with typing in `yes`):

  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

  The deployment takes couple of minutes. Observe the output. At the end you should see a summary similar to this:

  ```console
  bootstrap_storage_urls = <sensitive>
  lb_frontend_ips = {
    "private" = {
      "ha-ports" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
    "public" = {
      "palo-lb-app1-pip" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
  }
  password = <sensitive>
  username = "panadmin"
  vmseries_mgmt_ips = {
    "fw-in-1" = "1.2.3.4"
    "fw-in-2" = "1.2.3.4"
    "fw-obew-1" = "1.2.3.4"
    "fw-obew-2" = "1.2.3.4"
  }
  ```

- at this stage you have to wait couple of minutes for the firewalls to bootstrap.

### Post deploy

Firewalls in this example are configured with password authentication. To retrieve the initial credentials run:

- for username:

  ```bash
  terraform output username
  ```

- for password:

  ```bash
  terraform output password
  ```

The management public IP addresses are available in the `vmseries_mgmt_ips`:

```bash
terraform output vmseries_mgmt_ips
```

You can now login to the devices using either:

- cli - ssh client is required
- Web UI (https) - any modern web browser, note that initially the traffic is encrypted with a self-signed certificate.

As mentioned, the devices already contain `DAY0` configuration, so all network interfaces should be configured and Azure Load
Balancer should already report that the devices are healthy.

You can now proceed with licensing the devices and configuring your first rules.

Please also refer to [this repository](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/iron-skillet) for `DAY1` configuration
(security hardening).

### Cleanup

To remove the deployed infrastructure run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
