# Reference Architecture with Terraform: VM-Series in Azure, Centralized Architecture. Common NGFW Option

Palo Alto Networks produces several [validated reference architecture design and deployment documentation guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures), which describe well-architected and tested deployments. When deploying VM-Series in a public cloud, the reference architectures guide users toward the best security outcomes, whilst reducing rollout time and avoiding common integration efforts.
The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls in Azure based on a centralized design with common VM-Series for all traffic; for a discussion of other options, please see the design guide from [the reference architecture guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures).

## Reference Architecture Design

![simple](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-azurerm-vmseries-modules/assets/6574404/a7c2452d-f926-49da-bf21-9d840282a0a2)

This code implements:
- a _centralized design_, a hub-and-spoke topology with a Transit VNet containing VM-Series to inspect all inbound, outbound, east-west, and enterprise traffic
- the _common option_, which routes all traffic flows onto a single set of VM-Series

## Detailed Architecture and Design

### Centralized Design

This design uses a Transit VNet. Application functions and resources are deployed across multiple VNets that are connected in a hub-and-spoke topology. The hub of the topology, or transit VNet, is the central point of connectivity for all inbound, outbound, east-west, and enterprise traffic. You deploy all VM-Series firewalls within the transit VNet.

### Common Option

The common firewall option leverages a single set of VM-Series firewalls. The sole set of firewalls operates as a shared resource and may present scale limitations with all traffic flowing through a single set of firewalls due to the performance degradation that occurs when traffic crosses virtual routers. This option is suitable for proof-of-concepts and smaller scale deployments because the number of firewalls low. However, the technical integration complexity is high.

This reference architecture consists of:

* a VNET containing:
  * 4 subnets:
    * 3 of them dedicated to the firewalls: management, private and public
    * one dedicated to an Application Gateway
  * Route Tables and Network Security Groups
* 2 Load Balancers:
  * public - with a public IP address assigned, in front of the firewalls public interfaces, for incoming traffic
  * private - in front of the firewalls private interfaces, for outgoing and east-west traffic
* 2 firewalls:
  * deployed in different zones
  * with 3 network interfaces: management, public, private
  * with public IP addresses assigned to:
    * management interface
    * public interface - due to use of a public Load Balancer this public IP is used mainly for outgoing traffic
* an Application Gateway, serving as a reverse proxy for incoming traffic, with a sample rule setting the XFF header properly

## Prerequisites

A list of requirements might vary depending on the platform used to deploy the infrastructure but a minimum one includes:

* (in case of non cloud shell deployment) credentials and (optionally) tools required to authenticate against Azure Cloud, see [AzureRM provider documentation for details](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure)
* [supported](#requirements) version of [`Terraform`](<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads>)
* if you have not run Palo Alto NGFW images in a subscription it might be necessary to accept the license first ([see this note](../../modules/vmseries/README.md#accept-azure-marketplace-terms))

**NOTE:**

* after the deployment the firewalls remain not configured and not licensed
* this example contains some **files** that **can contain sensitive data**, namely the `TFVARS` file can contain bootstrap_options properties in `var.vmseries` definition. Keep in mind that **this code** is **only an example**. It's main purpose is to introduce the Terraform modules.

## Usage

### Deployment Steps

* checkout the code locally (if you haven't done so yet)
* copy the [`example.tfvars`](./example.tfvars) file, rename it to `terraform.tfvars` and adjust it to your needs (take a closer look at the `TODO` markers)
* (optional) authenticate to AzureRM, switch to the Subscription of your choice if necessary
* initialize the Terraform module:

      terraform init

* (optional) plan you infrastructure to see what will be actually deployed:

      terraform plan

* deploy the infrastructure (you will have to confirm it with typing in `yes`):

      terraform apply

  The deployment takes couple of minutes. Observe the output. At the end you should see a summary similar to this:

      Apply complete! Resources: 53 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

      Outputs:

      lb_frontend_ips = {
        "private" = {
          "ha-ports" = "1.2.3.4"
        }
        "public" = {
          "palo-lb-app1" = "1.2.3.4"
        }
      }
      password = <sensitive>
      username = "panadmin"
      vmseries_mgmt_ips = {
        "fw-1" = "1.2.3.4"
        "fw-2" = "1.2.3.4"
      }

* at this stage you have to wait couple of minutes for the firewalls to bootstrap.

### Post deploy

Firewalls in this example are configured with password authentication. To retrieve the initial credentials run:

* for username:

      terraform output username

* for password:

      terraform output password

The management public IP addresses are available in the `vmseries_mgmt_ips`:

```sh
terraform output vmseries_mgmt_ips
```

You can now login to the devices using either:

* cli - ssh client is required
* Web UI (https) - any modern web browser, note that initially the traffic is encrypted with a self-signed certificate.

You can now proceed with licensing and configuring the devices.

Please also refer to [this repository](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/iron-skillet) for `DAY1` configuration (security hardening).

### Cleanup

To remove the deployed infrastructure run:

```sh
terraform destroy
```

This value will be used during network interfaces creation.<br>- `add_to_appgw_backend` : bool, `false` by default, set this to `true` to add this backend to an Application Gateway.<br>- `avzone`: the Azure Availability Zone identifier ("1", "2", "3"). Default is "1".<br>- `availability_set_key` : a key of an Availability Set as declared in `availability_sets` property. Specify when HA is required but cannot go for zonal deployment.<br><br>- `bootstrap_options` : string, optional bootstrap options to pass to VM-Series instances, semicolon separated values. When defined this precedence over `bootstrap_storage`<br>- `bootstrap_storage` : a map containing definition of the bootstrap package content. When present triggers a creation of a File Share in an existing Storage Account, following properties supported:<br>  - `name` : a name of a key in `var.bootstrap_storage` variable defining a Storage Account<br>  - `static_files` : a map where key is a path to a file, value is the location of the file in the bootstrap package (file share). All files in this map are copied 1:1 to the bootstrap package<br>  - `template_bootstrap_xml` : path to the `bootstrap.xml` template. When defined it will trigger creation of the `bootstrap.xml` file and the file will be uploaded to the storage account. This is a simple `day 0` configuration file that should set up only basic networking. Specifying this property forces additional properties that are required to properly template the file. They can be defined per each VM or globally for all VMs (in this case place them in the bootstrap storage definition). The properties are listed below.<br>  - `public_snet_key` : required, name of the key in `var.vnets` map defining a public subnet, required to calculate the Azure router IP for the public subnet.<br>  - `private_snet_key` : required, name of the key in `var.vnets` map defining a private subnet, required to calculate the Azure router IP for the private subnet.<br>  - `intranet_cidr` : optional, CIDR of the private networks required to build a general static route to resources protected by this firewall, when skipped the 1st CIDR from `vnet_name` address space will be used.<br>  - `ai_update_interval` : if Application Insights are used this property can override the default metrics update interval (in minutes).<br><br>- `interfaces` : configuration of all NICs assigned to a VM. A list of maps, each map is a NIC definition. Notice that the order DOES matter. NICs are attached to VMs in Azure in the order they are defined in this list, therefore the management interface has to be defined first. Following properties are available:<br>  - `name`: string that will form the NIC name<br>  - `subnet_key` : (string) a key of a subnet as defined in `var.vnets`<br>  - `create_pip` : (boolean) flag to create Public IP for an interface, defaults to `false`<br>  - `public_ip_name` : (string) when `create_pip` is set to `false` a name of a Public IP resource that should be associated with this Network Interface<br>  - `public_ip_resource_group` : (string) when associating an existing Public IP resource, name of the Resource Group the IP is placed in, defaults to the `var.resource_group_name`<br>  - `load_balancer_key` : (string) key of a Load Balancer defined in the `var.loadbalancers`  variable, defaults to `null`<br>  - `private_ip_address` : (string) a static IP address that should be assigned to an interface, defaults to `null` (in that case DHCP is used)<br><br>Example:<pre>{<br>  "fw01" = {<br>    name = "firewall01"<br>    bootstrap_storage = {<br>      name                   = "storageaccountname"<br>      static_files           = { "files/init-cfg.txt" = "config/init-cfg.txt" }<br>      template_bootstrap_xml = "templates/bootstrap_common.tmpl"<br>      public_snet_key        = "public"<br>      private_snet_key       = "private"<br>    }<br>    avzone   = 1<br>    vnet_key = "trust"<br>    interfaces = [<br>      {<br>        name               = "mgmt"<br>        subnet_key         = "mgmt"<br>        create_pip         = true<br>        private_ip_address = "10.0.0.1"<br>      },<br>      {<br>        name                 = "trust"<br>        subnet_key           = "private"<br>        private_ip_address   = "10.0.1.1"<br>        load_balancer_key    = "private_lb"<br>      },<br>      {<br>        name                 = "untrust"<br>        subnet_key           = "public"<br>        private_ip_address   = "10.0.2.1"<br>        load_balancer_key    = "public_lb"<br>        public_ip_name       = "existing_public_ip"<br>      }<br>    ]<br>  }<br>}</pre> | `any` | n/a | yes |
| <a name="input_appgws"></a> [appgws](#input\_appgws) | A map defining all Application Gateways in the current deployment.<br><br>For detailed documentation on how to configure this resource, for available properties, especially for the defaults and the `rules` property refer to [module documentation](../../modules/appgw/README.md).<br><br>Following properties are supported:<br>- `name` : name of the Application Gateway.<br>- `vnet_key` : a key of a VNET defined in the `var.vnets` map.<br>- `subnet_key` : a key of a subnet as defined in `var.vnets`. This has to be a subnet dedicated to Application Gateways v2.<br>- `zones` : for zonal deployment this is a list of all zones in a region - this property is used by both: the Application Gateway and the Public IP created in front of the AppGW.<br>- `capacity` : (optional) number of Application Gateway instances, not used when autoscalling is enabled (see `capacity_min`)<br>- `capacity_min` : (optional) when set enables autoscaling and becomes the minimum capacity<br>- `capacity_max` : (optional) maximum capacity for autoscaling<br>- `enable_http2` : enable HTTP2 support on the Application Gateway<br>- `waf_enabled` : (optional) enables WAF Application Gateway, defining WAF rules is not supported, defaults to `false`<br>- `vmseries_public_nic_name` : name of the public VMSeries interface as defined in `interfaces` property.<br>- `managed_identities` : (optional) a list of existing User-Assigned Managed Identities, which Application Gateway uses to retrieve certificates from Key Vault<br>- `ssl_policy_type` : (optional) type of an SSL policy, defaults to `Predefined`<br>- `ssl_policy_name` : (optional) name of an SSL policy, for `ssl_policy_type` set to `Predefined`<br>- `ssl_policy_min_protocol_version` : (optional) minimum version of the TLS protocol for SSL Policy, for `ssl_policy_type` set to `Custom`<br>- `ssl_policy_cipher_suites` : (optional) a list of accepted cipher suites, for `ssl_policy_type` set to `Custom`<br>- `ssl_profiles` : (optional) a map of SSL profiles that can be later on referenced in HTTPS listeners by providing a name of the profile in the `ssl_profile_name` property | `map` | `{}` | no |
