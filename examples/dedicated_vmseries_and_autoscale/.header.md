# Reference Architecture with Terraform: VM-Series in Azure, Centralized Architecture, Dedicated Inbound NGFW Option with Autoscaling

Palo Alto Networks produces several
[validated reference architecture design and deployment documentation guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures),
which describe well-architected and tested deployments. When deploying VM-Series in a public cloud, the reference architectures
guide users toward the best security outcomes, whilst reducing rollout time and avoiding common integration efforts.

The Terraform code presented here will deploy Palo Alto Networks VM-Series firewalls in Azure based on a centralized design with
dedicated-inbound VM-Series with autoscaling(Virtual Machine Scale Sets); for a discussion of other options, please see the design
guide from [the reference architecture guides](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/resources/reference-architectures).

Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) are used for autoscaling to run the Next Generation Firewalls, with custom data plane oriented
metrics published by PanOS it is possible to adjust the number of firewall appliances to the current workload (data plane
utilization). Since firewalls are added or removed automatically, they cannot be managed in a classic way. Therefore they are not
assigned with public IP addresses. To ease licensing, management and updates a Panorama appliance is suggested. Deployment of a
Panorama instance is not covered in this example, but a [dedicated one exists](../standalone_panorama/README.md).

## Reference Architecture Design

![simple](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/terraform-azurerm-vmseries-modules/assets/6574404/a7c2452d-f926-49da-bf21-9d840282a0a2)

This code implements:

- a *centralized design*, a hub-and-spoke topology with a Transit VNet containing VM-Series to inspect all inbound, outbound,
  east-west, and enterprise traffic
- the *dedicated inbound option*, which separates inbound traffic flows onto a separate set of VM-Series
- *auto scaling* for the VM-Series, where Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) are used to provision VM-Series that will scale in and
  out dynamically, as workload demands fluctuate

## Detailed Architecture and Design

### Centralized Design

This design uses a Transit VNet. Application functions and resources are deployed across multiple VNets that are connected in a
hub-and-spoke topology. The hub of the topology, or transit VNet, is the central point of connectivity for all inbound, outbound,
east-west, and enterprise traffic. You deploy all VM-Series firewalls within the transit VNet.

### Dedicated Inbound Option

The dedicated inbound option separates traffic flows across two separate sets of VM-Series firewalls. One set of VM-Series
firewalls is dedicated to inbound traffic flows, allowing for greater flexibility and scaling of inbound traffic loads. The second
set of VM-Series firewalls services all outbound, east-west, and enterprise network traffic flows. This deployment choice offers
increased scale and operational resiliency and reduces the chances of high bandwidth use from the inbound traffic flows affecting
other traffic flows within the deployment.

This reference architecture consists of:

- a VNET containing:
  - 4 subnets:
    - 3 of them dedicated to the firewalls: management, private and public
    - one dedicated to an Application Gateway
  - Route Tables and Network Security Groups
- 2 Virtual Machine Scale sets:
  - one for inbound, one for outbound and east-west traffic
  - with 3 network interfaces: management, public, private
  - no public addresses are assigned to firewalls' interfaces
- 2 Load Balancers:
  - public - with a public IP address assigned, in front of the public interfaces of the inbound VMSS, for incoming traffic
  - private - in front of the firewalls private interfaces of the OBEW VMSS, for outgoing and east-west traffic
- a NAT Gateway responsible for handling the outgoing traffic for the management (updates) and public (outbound traffic in OBEW
- firewalls mainly) interfaces
- 2 Application Insights, one per each scale set, used to store the custom PanOS metrics
- an Application Gateway, serving as a reverse proxy for incoming traffic, with a sample rule setting the XFF header properly

A note on resiliency - this is an example of a none zonal deployment. Resiliency is maintained by using fault domains (Scale Set's
default mechanism).

### Auto Scaling VM-Series

Auto scaling: Public-cloud environments focus on scaling out a deployment instead of scaling up. This architectural difference
stems primarily from the capability of public-cloud environments to dynamically increase or decrease the number of resources
allocated to your environment. Using native Azure services like Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS), Application Insights and
VM-Series automation features, the guide implements VM-Series that will scale in and out dynamically, as your protected workload
demands fluctuate. The VM-Series firewalls are deployed in separate Virtual Machine Scale Sets for inbound and outbound/east-west
firewalls, and are automatically registered to Azure Load Balancers.

## Prerequisites

A list of requirements might vary depending on the platform used to deploy the infrastructure but a minimum one includes:

- (in case of non cloud shell deployment) credentials and (optionally) tools required to authenticate against Azure Cloud, see
  [AzureRM provider documentation for details](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure)
- [supported](#requirements) version of [`Terraform`](<https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads>)
- if you have not run Palo Alto NGFW images in a subscription it might be necessary to accept the license first
  ([see this note](../../modules/vmseries/README.md#accept-azure-marketplace-terms))

A non-platform requirement would be a running Panorama instance. For full automation you might want to consider the following
requirements:

- a template and a template stack with `DAY0` configuration
- a device group with security configuration (`DAY1` [iron skillet](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/iron-skillet) for example)
  and any security and NAT rules of your choice
- a [Panorama Software Firewall License](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/vm-series/9-1/vm-series-deployment/license-the-vm-series-firewall/use-panorama-based-software-firewall-license-management) plugin to automatically manage licenses on newly created devices
- a [VM-Series](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/panorama/9-1/panorama-admin/panorama-plugins/plugins-types/install-the-vm-series-plugin-on-panorama)
  plugin to enable additional template options (custom metrics)

**Note!**

- after the deployment the firewalls remain not configured and not licensed.
- this example contains some **files** that **can contain sensitive data**. Keep in mind that **this code** is
  **only an example**. It's main purpose is to introduce the Terraform modules.

## Usage

### Deployment Steps

- checkout the code locally (if you haven't done so yet)
- copy the [`example.tfvars`](./example.tfvars) file, rename it to `terraform.tfvars` and adjust it to your needs (take a closer
  look at the `TODO` markers). If you already have a configured Panorama (with at least minimum configuration described above) you
  might want to also adjust the `bootstrap_options` for each scale set ([inbound](./example.tfvars#L205) and
  [obew](./example.tfvars#L249) separately).
- (optional) authenticate to AzureRM, switch to the Subscription of your choice if necessary
- initialize the Terraform module:

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

- (optional) plan you infrastructure to see what will be actually deployed:

  ```bash
  terraform plan
  ```

- deploy the infrastructure (you will have to confirm it with typing in `yes`):

  ```bash
  terraform apply
  ```

  The deployment takes couple of minutes. Observe the output. At the end you should see a summary similar to this:

  ```console
  Apply complete! Resources: 52 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

  Outputs:

  lb_frontend_ips = {
    "private" = {
      "ha-ports" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
    "public" = {
      "palo-lb-app1-pip" = "1.2.3.4"
    }
  }
  metrics_instrumentation_keys = <sensitive>
  password = <sensitive>
  username = "panadmin"
  ```

- at this stage you have to wait couple of minutes for the firewalls to bootstrap.

### Post deploy

The most important post-deployment action is (for deployments with auto scaling and Panorama) to retrieve the Application Insights
instrumentation keys. This can be done by looking up the AI resources in the Azure portal, or directly from Terraform outputs:

```bash
terraform output metrics_instrumentation_keys
```

The retrieved keys should be put into appropriate templates in Panorama and pushed to the devices. From this moment on, custom
metrics are being sent to Application Insights and retrieved by Virtual Machine Scale Sets to trigger scale-in and scale-out
operations.

Although firewalls in a Scale Set are not meant to be managed directly, they are still configured with password authentication.
To retrieve the initial credentials run:

- for username:

  ```bash
  terraform output username
  ```

- for password:

  ```bash
  terraform output password
  ```

### Cleanup

To remove the deployed infrastructure run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
