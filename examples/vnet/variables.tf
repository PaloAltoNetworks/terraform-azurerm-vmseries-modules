  Map of Network Security Groups to create. The key of each entry acts as the Network Security Group name.
  List of available attributes of each Network Security Group entry:
  - `location` : (Optional) Specifies the Azure location where to deploy the resource.
  - `rules`: A list of objects representing a Network Security Rule. The key of each entry acts as the name of the rule and
      needs to be unique across all rules in the Network Security Group.
      List of attributes available to define a Network Security Rule:
      - `priority` : Numeric priority of the rule. The value can be between 100 and 4096 and must be unique for each rule in the collection.
      The lower the priority number, the higher the priority of the rule.
      - `direction` : The direction specifies if rule will be evaluated on incoming or outgoing traffic. Possible values are `Inbound` and `Outbound`.
      - `access` : Specifies whether network traffic is allowed or denied. Possible values are `Allow` and `Deny`.
      - `protocol` : Network protocol this rule applies to. Possible values include `Tcp`, `Udp`, `Icmp`, or `*` (which matches all).
      - `source_port_range` : List of source ports or port ranges.
      - `destination_port_range` : Destination Port or Range. Integer or range between `0` and `65535` or `*` to match any.
      - `source_address_prefix` : List of source address prefixes. Tags may not be used.
      - `destination_address_prefix` : CIDR or destination IP range or `*` to match any IP.

  Example:
  ```

  Map of objects describing a Route Table. The key of each entry acts as the Route Table name.
  List of available attributes of each Route Table entry:
