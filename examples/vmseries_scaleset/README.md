# Palo Alto Networks VM-Series Scalset Module Example

>Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) â€” A VMSS is a group of individual virtual machines (VMs) within the Microsoft Azure public cloud that administrators can configure and manage as a single unit. The firewall templates provided for auto scaling, create and manage a group of identical, load balanced VM-Series firewalls that are scaled up or down based on custom metrics published by the firewalls to Azure Application Insights. The scaling-in and scaling out operation can be based on configurable thresholds.

This folder shows an example of Terraform code that helps to deploy an auto-scaling tier of VM-Series firewalls using Azure VMSS.
